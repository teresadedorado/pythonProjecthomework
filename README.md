I will make a list of the things I did to create this homework
1. I created a new project and called it homework
2. I created a folder and named it homework 1
3. I went to VCS on my screen and connected to git tub
4. In git tub I created a new code as a read me 
5. I went back to pycharm and pulled the file 
6. Lastly I started writing this list
7. Now I will push the project so I can see my list in git tub
8. Then I will send you the link through email so you can see my work
